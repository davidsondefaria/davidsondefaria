👤 My name is Davidson and I'm a Fullstack Developer based at Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently working at Crowdform with software development. I started as Frontend Developer in 2019 and in 2020 changed to Fullstack Developer where I worked mainly on web projects, built softwares and mobile app, and now I develop AI based products.

- 🎓 My passion for programming started during my graduation in Computational Physics, where I acquired my first knowledge in C and JavaScript, as well as getting in touch with several multidisciplinary areas that interested me. I participated in game development projects for children with autism, studied optimization and parallelization of neural networks for cortical maps, molecular dynamics and machine learning for predicting actions.

- 💻 By the end of the course, I understood that computing and statistics were the common thread among those I considered the most interesting fields. So I decided to work as a developer and start a Masters in Computer Science. Plus I started studying data science on my own.


- 🖥️ In my first job as a front-end developer, I began working with React, started to learn some engineering and data analysis related skills, went back to web development learning the back-end via the MERN stack and now, in my second job, I work with several technologies needed to build software from the server to web and mobile applications.

> So that's me 👨‍💻. A full-stack developer who is enthusiastic about data and artificial intelligence and who, academically, uses technology to make the web more accessible for people with autism (and who knows, everyone).
