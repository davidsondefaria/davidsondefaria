## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Davidson!

### ðŸ‘¤ About Me
I'm a Fullstack Developer hailing from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a knack for building AI-based products. I kicked off my journey in tech as a Frontend Developer in 2019, pivoting to a Fullstack role in 2020.

### ðŸŽ“ Academic Background
My roots are in Computational Physics, where I got my first hands-on experience with C and JavaScript. During this period, I delved into various multidisciplinary projects, from game development for children with autism to machine learning and neural network optimization.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Transitioning into development, I quickly fell in love with React and soon broadened my horizons to the MERN stack. Now, my go-to stack is NestJS + TypeScript + React. I've also had the opportunity to work with various databases and cloud tools.

### ðŸš€ Recent Projects
I've taken on a multitude of challenging projects recently, including a sales website, an NFT subscription platform, and even an AI project. Each one has been a unique learning experience, enhancing my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

### ðŸ‘¥ Soft Skills
Among my strengths are teamwork, dependability, and flexibility. These skills have served me well across diverse teams and fast-paced tech environments, and they fuel my aspiration to become a tech leader in the near future.

ðŸŒŸ Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my repos and reach out for collaborations or discussions. ðŸŒŸ
